### API

...

### Design decisions

**Database**
- A separate BOOK_COPY entry instead of a copy count on BOOK
    - allows per-physical-copy properties like *condition* (or shelf location, etc.)
    - each borrow references exactly one copy
- Reservations keep status instead of deletion on fulfill/cancel
    - allows misuse prevention (think of client reserving-cancelling multiple times)
    - allows analytics, if that is preferred.
- Junction table for AUTHOR and BOOK instead of author list on book
    - forced decision by many-to-many relationship
